                          <p>These principles have one goal: so you can give more to life.</p>

                          <p>In the process, you'll most likely also get more out of life.</p>
                          <p>I love to read a lot of books and articles and have conversations about life, the world, humans, and a couple other interesting things, so this is a compilation of some of my favorite perspectives on life.</p>
                          <p>Sometimes I would think about these perspectives or talk with friends about them, but after a while it made more sense to write them down — writing helped develop these ideas, merge what I thought were different perspectives, separate what I thought was a single concept, and visualize all these thoughts in front of me instead of going through one by one in my head. </p>

                          <p>You already 'know' most of this. However, I like to have these concepts always fresh in my head. The simple things to do are also the simple things to not do.</p>
                          <p>These cards are actually mostly for myself so I can do what I mentioned above, but if you found this website or I sent it to you, congrats. Enjoy it and look at it with an open mind. If you'd like to tell me something, send me a message if you know me or an email to valpe70 at gmail.com. As I said, I love having thoughtful conversations so let me know what you think. I'd like to understand more.</p>

                <p>It’s literally a miracle you’re alive or even that humans exist. There's so many inspirational videos and cliché quotes about how "you only have one life" or "make it count", but they exist for a reason.</p>
                <p>Dreams don't work unless you do. And if you're if you're going to dream, you might as well dream big; your life is going to take the same time no matter what you dream.</p>
                <p>You can do whatever you want to do in life, but it's good to <i>think</i> about what you want to do. If you procrastinate on thinking and choosing what you want to do, your choice will inevitably be made by circumstance.</p>
                <p>Let the giant that lay dormant inside you out to play; dream bigger than you think you can.</p>

                <h4>Dust If You Must</h4>
                <h5>by Rose Milligan</h5>
                <p>Dust if you must, but wouldn't it be better<br />To paint a picture, or write a letter,<br />Bake a cake, or plant a seed;<br />Ponder the difference between want and need?</p>
                <p>Dust if you must, but there's not much time,<br />With rivers to swim, and mountains to climb;<br />Music to hear, and books to read;<br />Friends to cherish, and life to lead.</p>
                <p>Dust if you must, but the world's out there<br />With the sun in your eyes, and the wind in your hair;<br />A flutter of snow, a shower of rain,<br />This day will not come around again.</p>
                <p>Dust if you must, but bear in mind,<br />Old age will come and it's not kind.<br />And when you go (and go you must)<br />You, yourself, will make more dust.</p>

                <p>Being more aware allows you to figure out what's true, what's interesting, what matters, and what's meaningful. Awareness and thought allows you to understand the principles in this website and see new ones. All ideas and thinking come from being more conscious and thoughtful. TODO: define conscious as aware + thoughtful.</p>
                <p>You could say an eagle is more conscious than a beetle. And a chimpanzee is more conscious than an eagle. A human is more conscious than an eagle, but can there be something more conscious than said human? For sure, why wouldn't it keep going? It could be some aliens, some god, or <i>other humans</i>. Realizing that there’s different consciousness steps even within our human level is really important for personal growth, because you stop thinking humans are the definition of 'conscious' beings and realize there's still more to learn and improve.</p>
                <h3>Understand other people</h3>
                <p>Just because people make different choices than you, they are not stupid. Often times it's simply not being aware of the full picture; maybe themselves or maybe yourself. You don’t know everything about people, so don’t judge them — help them. Being more conscious allows us to understand other people better.</p>
                <h3>
                Wisdom sheds light on what fulfillment and meaningful mean
                </h3>
                <p>Focusing on becoming wiser let's you figure out what you find fullfilling and meaningful. </p>
                <p>It seems that what people are universally looking for the most — usually confused with happiness — is fulfillment. Some people are looking for fame, fortune, relationships, happiness, but really what they're looking for is fulfillment. This 'fulfillment' can come in many forms and it can change from person to person, like achieving a life-long dream, making a positive impact on the world, being passionate about some work, or having children. It's usually selfless acts of contribution.</p>
                <p>Experiences and learning while being conscious all along give you wisdom. Wisdom is having deathbed clarity while you're still alive so you can make the choices that matter and get you and the world around you more fulfilled.</p>
                <p>I think that collectively as humans our central goal should be to figure out what's important, meaningful and act on it. Both realizing what's important and making sure we make the best actions come from being wiser, which comes from being more conscious and thoughtful.</p>

							</div>
							<div class="card__copy">
								<p>If you focus on growth, you’ll end up at your definition of somewhere good regardless of where you stand now.</p>
								<p>Slopes of lines is an extremely simple concept. This relationship between x and y is so obvious in Math that it is not paid the attention it deserves. But I think this mathematical truism reveals a pretty good guideline for life. </p>
								<p>If you have two lines, the line with greater growth will <i>for sure</i> be above the other one (and gain a lot of advantage), <i>regardless of the starting points</i>.</p>
								<p>The real insight comes from changing the perspective on what the x and y axes can means — like anything good (y) and time (x).</p>
                                <p>Pic</p>
                            	<p>The starting red line, even with a lower Y-intercept, eventually crosses the blue line. Simply because it has a little bit more slope. In other words, growth.</p>

	<p>
	Then if the Y-axis is something good, depending on your definition of something good, it’s more advantageous to pick the red trajectory over the blue trajectory. This concept can be extended to several things.</p>
	<p>
	Take knowledge for example. Nowadays, people emphasize too much how much you currently know (y-intercept), and not the rate of new learning or initiative (slope). However, how fast one learns is more promising than how much one already knows. That guy who’s been coding for five years? If you’re dedicated to programming enough, it’s a likely possibility that you can catch up to, and even surpass him in a year’s time.</p>
	<p>
	That goes to say that you shouldn’t be afraid of trying new things. Even if you’re bad at something, you can always catch up. The kid on the varsity soccer team? Start playing eight hours per day and he won’t be looking as impressive in a few months. It’s never too late for venturing onto new things; you shouldn’t forgo fields of expertise entirely just because there are other people that are much better at it than you.</p>
<p>
The takeaway is that if you focus on growth, you’ll end up at your definition of somewhere good regardless of where you stand now.</p>
<p><b>
Try new things, practice intensely what you want to be good at, and always remember that <i>a little bit of slope makes up for a lot of y-intercept</i>.</b></p>

                <h2>Start With Why</h2>
                <p>People aren’t inspired by what, they’re inspired by why. From the things we buy, the jobs we do, and the actions we take, why is more inspiring than what, and people universally seek inspiration and fulfillment more than anything else. </p>
                <p>People come together and bond on shared beliefs. The survival of the human race depends on our ability to surround ourselves with people who believe what we believe. Communities and cultures are a group of people that share common values and beliefs. </p>

								<p>Make the outside of your comfort zone your happy place.</p>
                <p>It is a fundamental law of nature that to evolve one has to push one’s limits, which is painful, in order to gain strength—whether it’s in the form of lifting weights, facing problems head-on, or in any other way.</p>
                <p>Success starts at the end of your comfort zone.</p>
                <h3>Dealing with fear and uncertainty</h3>
                <p>Everyone experiences fear. Some run away from it but some embrace it. Outcomes are defined by your decisions and actions, regardless of how scared you feel. And it's super normal to feel uncertainty and to be very scared, but don't let your choices be determined by fear; instead be aware of that fear, embrace it, and consciously act according to your hopes instead.</p>
                <h3>Life colored by the chaos of trouble</h3>
                <p>For some people, the best thing and the worst thing that has happened in their lives is the same thing.</p>
                <p>Even though they can be very tough at some points, hardships can transform people. Often times, the only way to endure them is to become a new person. Radically new perspectives and a great sense of understanding can come through dealing with problems. I don't wish bad to anyone</p>
                <p>Anything that gives light must endure burning.</p>
                <p>It's a matter of perspective. Harness chaos and use it as fuel.</p>

								<p>Reason from first principles rather than by analogy. With analogy, we do things the way they have been done or that others are doing. With first principles, you boil things down to the most fundamental truths and reason up from there.</p>
								<p> When you’re trying to create a new product or service, it’s critical to use this framework. For example, first principles gave Elon Musk a big edge when building electric batteries for Tesla and SolarCity and rockets for SpaceX. Consider building a rocket. Conventionally, people would search for how much a NASA rocket is worth and make an estimate for what it would take to build one. Instead, Musk’s team analyzed the necessary parts of a rocket, then researched the prices of the raw materials of parts firsthand. As a result, the SpaceX team was surprised to learn that they could build a rocket that cost around two percent of the typical price. And three times as efficient in flight.</p>

                            <p>When we're little we usually have a lot of dreams. Of what we want to be and what we want to do. Over time we might accomplish some, but sometimes they're too many to do them all. We also find out flying or magic is pretty hard. It's pretty fun to think back to what your dreams were; which have changed, and which have remained. It's a cool exercise to remember what you find exciting and what your inner kid has always wanted to do.</p>
                            <p>Everyone is built very differently; you’re the one who knows best what you value, what you’re good at, what you can improve, what you enjoy, and what you want to do.</p>
